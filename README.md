# cppcgen

A C++ -> C code generator using libclang.

Note: this is not meant to be a full transpiler. It's currently used to convert maplibre-native's C++ code to C for use with Flutter's ffigen tool.

I might be slow to respond to issues and PRs, as this is not a project that I will actively maintain. Feel free, however, to fork and modify it for any use case you have in mind!
